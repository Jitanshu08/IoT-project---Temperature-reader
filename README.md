# IoT-project---Temperature-reader
Designing a PCB to get the data from the sensor and calculating the ADC through the Arduino microcontroller and uploading it to the dedicated Arduino server.

PCB design folder consist of the one layer design and i have also uploaded the 2 layer design as "PCB design 2layer". The values collected from the sensor is also uploaded as sample values first column the ADC count(analogue reading from the sensor) and the second column shows the voltage that can be converted it into temperature(*100).
